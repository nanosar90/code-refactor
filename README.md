homework for bootcamp

GIVEN the Horiseon webpage I ensured it met accessibility standards by adding alt text to all images that lacked them, which was all. 

WHEN I viewed the source code

THEN I ensured all elements were semantic HTML elements

WHEN I viewed the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I ensured that the elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I viewed the image elements

THEN I input accessible alt attributes

WHEN I viewed the heading attributes

THEN ensured they fell in sequential order

WHEN I viewed the title element

THEN I input a concise, descriptive title

**Additional comments**

I ensured all links worked on the NAV bar

I added additional META data for Search Engine Optimization

I added a title to the DIV element that had an image in the CSS due to not being able to use the alt attribute in css

This assignment was to be given a website that lacked certain functionality, fix it, and also add the functionality to the site for individuals that may be blind using screen reading technology for pictures, and to add additional search engine optimization. I feel I met those criteria on this homework assignment. I will admit there was some compression I could have done on the CSS side of things, but did not take a deep dive into those due to those not specifically being listed on the read me... and I don't really know how these assignments work yet... it's not like being handed a math assignment and being told to do problems 1-20.
